The invasion .xcf file is a gimp file with about 20 layers.

Just download it and muck around however you like - I have the original archived...a lot.

The spaceship is an imported vector which I turned into a paint brush in order to make the little spaceships in the distance.

I'll see if I can find the vector version of the spaceship...
